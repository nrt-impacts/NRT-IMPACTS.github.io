## Inclusion
The IMPACTS program consists of a community of people from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. We encourage diverse perspectives and approaches to science. We strive for 
positive institutional and cultural change, with the goal of ensuring that the Program reflects and upholds our shared ideals as scientists, educators, scholars, students, and 
community members. We are committed to identifying ways to build a culturally diverse environment by listening to our community members and implementing practices to foster 
inclusivity. We pledge to improve campus climate pertaining to ableism, ageism, ethnocentrism, homophobia, racism, religious oppression, sexism, sexual misconduct, transphobia, 
and other forms of marginalization. We value diversity, reject judgments based on differences, and instead embrace those differences as assets. Our success depends on our 
diversity and together we will shape the future.
