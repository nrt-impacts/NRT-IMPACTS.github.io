## WHY PARTICIPATE AS A STUDENT TRAINEE?

The IMPACTS program features five components focused on training the next generation of scientists that can employ computational and data science approaches to analyze and interpret heterogeneous, multi-scale measurement data to predict plant responses in variable environments at local to global scales.

At the end of the program, the trainee will:

* Obtain foundational knowledge in both biology and computation through project-based learning where the Trainees work collaboratively to resolve challenging problems.
* Have the expertise to identify unresolved questions interfacing plant biology and computation, and to develop and execute innovative research approaches to address them.
* Gain verbal and written communication skills to interact with their peers across disciplines and with a wide range of stakeholders, including policymakers and the public.
* Develop leadership and management skills so the Trainees can take on leadership roles in collaborative teams and manage project efficiently.
* Develop teaching and mentoring skills so the Trainees become effective communicators in the classroom and can serve as a mentor in a collaborative team.
* The program is designed to prepare Trainees for a wide range of career options in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics in academia, industry, governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, and beyond. You will interact with a group of highly motivated Trainees with divergent background and expertise as a cohort.

There are three potential ways to participate in  the program:

* For students who want to participate in any component  
* For students seeking travel support
* For students seeking fellowship support
