## Our Mission
Our understanding of how plants function has been significantly advanced by genomics research. Application of genomics has yielded datasets with the potential to revolutionize plant sciences and to ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable production of food and biofuels for a rapidly increasing global population.  To achieve this, there is a critical need for next-generation scientists with both an understanding of plant biology and computational skills. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Michigan State University will address this demand by training doctoral students who can employ advanced computational and data science approaches to address grand challenges in plant biology.
